## Physics-informed Advection-Diffusion for merging traffic with occlusion uncertainty
### the data-driven version is under construction, stay tuned!
This folder contains the sample codes for the DRIFT demonstration with architected physics-based risk field refractor with vehicle-coupled advection and boundary constraints

Features: 
- Local advection
- Smooth diffusion
- Occlusion handling
- Merging pressure
- Fixed plot range

### demonstrations of the advection-diffusion effects with merging topology and occlusion using the empirical PDE parameters (pending fine-tuning):
